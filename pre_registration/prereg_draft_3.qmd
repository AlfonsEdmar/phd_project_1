"if you don't have any theory about how you're going to explore the (statistical) heterogeneity \[...\] then \[...\] exploring it just means you spent more time doing it and not learning much more" -- participant 17 [@lorenc_meta-analysis_2016]

# 1. The Question

The main goal of this paper is to address how heterogeneity impacts the validity of evidence synthesis. Specifically, we want to examine the problem of comparability across pooled effects and how researchers deal with problematic heterogeneity. Another way to phrase this question could be: at what point are qualitative differences between scientific inquiries into the same underlying psychological construct large enough that we conclude that the effects we are measuring are different; regardless of whether a measurable difference is present? In essence, we want to know what causes the exclusion of a study from a meta-analysis due to perceived methodological diversity or heterogeneity. In order to answer this question, a semi-mixed methods approach is needed. This is because we want to qualitatively examine heterogeneity issues in systematic reviews, and the qualitative AND quantitative heterogeneity issues in meta-analyses. To do this a qualitative content analysis of the systematic review literature, and a scoping review of the meta-analysis literature will be conducted.

# 2. Introduction

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are usually described as the gold-standard in terms of providing evidence for scientific theories. However, for these types of analyses to be conducted a suitably body of literature is needed. What makes a literature suitable for review is therefore an important question to ask in order to gauge whether a synthesis of evidence is possible. The answer to this question depends on the field in which the review is conducted, and the type of research question asked.

One of the main reasons to not conduct a meta-analysis even though a suitably large body of literature on a topic exist, is that the individual papers within that literature are so different from one another that the comparability of the individual studies comes into question. This variability across studies is commonly referred to as between-study heterogeneity. In this context heterogeneity refers to the variation in observed effects. While this definition is simple enough, it does not capture the nuances of what variability in observed effects *mean*. In order to set up our working definition of heterogeneity we need to make some clarifications on what we mean by effects and what we mean by variability.

## 2.1 Effects and Variance

With effects we mean the counterfactual difference between states dependent on whether something is present or not, and if present, to what degree it is so. If we assume that an effect has a single true value that we can estimate and that the variation in that effect tends towards zero as our sample size increases we assume that the effect is fixed. If we assume that the effect varies dependent on some underlying parameters, we assume that the effect is random.

With variability, we mean the mathematical concept of variance. Variance describes the average squared distance from a mean. It provides a measure for how varied a set of data points are with large values indicating high variation and low values indicating low variation. Another way to phrase this is that variance describes our degree of uncertainty about a mean. That is, to what degree we can expect to be wrong about estimating a mean value.

## 2.2 Heterogeneity and Uncertainty

One of the main distinguishing features between heterogeneity and variance is that heterogeneity has an accompanying distribution which indicates what sort of dispersion we can expect from studies measuring the same effect. Both variance and heterogeneity are measures of uncertainty, but with heterogeneity we have a framework to discern whether the observed variation is a product of naturally occurring sampling error or indicative of having captured multiple true effects in the pool of studies. This is the foundation of why some refer to heterogeneity as unexpected variation, or uncertainty about a mean value to the extent that it does not fit the expected distribution of a true effect(REF). In this paper we will not distinguish between inherent sampling error of true effects and the measurement of variation in effects that might consist of having multiple true effect sizes in a sample. The reason for this is because the notion of a *true* fixed psychological effect in the context of a meta-analysis is rather abstract. As with all constructs in social science, effects observed in psychology are dependent on multiple unobserved variables that could explain much of the variation in those effects. Therefore we will disregard definitions of heterogeneity that claim to be indications of ''unexpected variation'' or variation due to having captured multiple true effects - since all observed effects of interest in psychology are the product of multiple true effects. This is especially true when we define our effects as latent, which is the case when we use methods like structural equation modelling (SEM) or meta-analysis.

Because we assume that latent psychological effects are conditional on multiple unobserved variables, we are making a claim that are uncertainty about the effect can be reduced if we have more information. That is, our uncertainty is *epistemic*, or, knowable. In the context of a meta-analysis which aims to estimate a latent effect, the inclusion of moderating variables are endeavours to reduce our uncertainty about the effect. In a situation where no more information exists to further explain potential variation in an effect, our uncertainty about it is *aleatory*, meaning that it is random in the sense that it follows a probability distribution in which no parameter can predict its outcome. To our knowledge, this has never happened in the field of psychology, and the often low explained variability in psychological constructs is a testament to this(REF).

Since the concept of heterogeneity is closely tied with that of epistemic uncertainty, how heterogeneity is categorised is often dependent on where the source of the uncertainty is attributed. This varies across fields of study, in medicine the Cochrane typology of clinical and methodological heterogeneity is often distinguished, and in political science lines are drawn between treatment contrasts, participant moderators, and contextual moderators. The only true agreement on what heterogeneity means comes in it's statistical form, namely $\tau^2$, meaning effect variance. Henceforth when we refer to heterogeneity we will be talking explicitly about $\tau^2$ under the assumption that our uncertainty about the effect ($\mu$) is mostly epistemic. That is, the majority of the variation in an effect is attributable to it consisting of multiple true effects, which in theory are knowable.

While this notion of what we can call ''epistemic heterogeneity'' may seem slightly arcane to most applied researchers, it is a useful terms since it has statistical underpinnings but is not necessarily an emergent or caused effect like observed statistical heterogeneity. In other words, we can see epistemic heterogeneity as the cause that results in the effect which is observed statistical heterogeneity. This is a theoretical claim that results in the assumption that statistical heterogeneity cannot exist without epistemic heterogeneity, but the absence of statistical heterogeneity is not indicative of an absence of epistemic heterogeneity. This in turn illustrates the importance in evaluating the potential sources of epistemic heterogeneity carefully before conducting any type of evidence synthesis.

This conundrum lies at the heart of the goal with this paper since we want to assess where the comparability between studies breaks down and forces the authors to conduct a purely qualitative evidence synthesis that does not mathematically combine measures across studies.

# 3. Methods

This paper will consist of two dependent studies, one scoping review and one qualitative content analysis. A mixing procedure where the result from both studies are thematically synthesised to provide a nuanced answer to our research question will also be conducted. It cannot be stressed enough that while there are surface level similarities between these two analyses, they are categorically different and their results cannot be directly compared. It is through the mixing procedure where an answer to the over-arching research question can be addressed. Simply put, we want to know when epistemic heterogeneity is an issue, but to properly answer this question we need to analyse when pooling data was judged to be mostly a statistical issue and when pooling data was judged to not be possible on qualitative grounds. We address the former with a scoping review and the latter with a qualitative content analysis. Figure 1 depicts a flow chart of how our overarching research question gets partitioned into more targeted research questions which require different modes of inquiry, and then how the results from both analyses are integrated to answer the initial question.

## 3.1 The Scoping Review

A scoping review is a type of evidence synthesis akin to a systematic review or a traditional literature review. The main difference between a systematic review and a scoping review is that the scoping review is a more iterative process designed to identify knowledge gaps, scope out a body of work, clarify concepts or investigate research conduct. As such, the synthesis of the scoping review is not designed to provide a summary of research findings from individual studies; but generate broader mapping of evidence, not unlike a traditional literature review.

Given that our goal is to clarify the concept of heterogeneity, and assess how the execution of research is impacted by the presence of heterogeneity, a scoping review is preferable to a systematic review[@munn_systematic_2018]. An alternative to a scoping review could be a rapid review; that being a feasibility constrained systematic review. However, it is not the feasibility of our investigation that informs our method - it is the underlying research question. Since we are mainly concerned with the qualia of heterogeneity, a quantitative assessment of the literature does not target the question; even though the literature itself is quantitative in nature.

This review will follow the guidelines provided by JBI to the greatest extent possible for the research question at hand[@noauthor_jbi_2020]. In essence, this means that an a priori protocol of the review including the exclusion criteria, search strategy, methodology and reporting will be conducted. One deviation from the recommendations will be present in the searching procedure due to the nature of the literature we are interested in. Since the JBI guidelines are compatible with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) [@tricco_prisma_2018], that reporting scheme will be followed in the manuscript.

### 3.1.1 Eligibility Criteria

To be included in the systematic scoping review, any document needs to be a meta-analysis within psychology science published in 2021 or 2022 to capture recently published studies. Additionally, documents must have a theoretical research question that requires the synthesis of evidence across multiple independent studies to be included. This means that studies posing meta-research will be excluded. An example of a meta-research question would be an evaluation of the prevalence of open-science practices or replications within a given field. The data within the documents must also have been generated through a systematic search of literature, this excludes sequential studies that aggregate their findings using an 'internal meta-analysis'.

In sum, for a study to be included in the scoping review it needs to: 1) be a meta-analysis conducted using standard literature search strategies; 2) cover a psychological concept; and 3) be published in 2021 or 2022.

### 3.1.2 Search Strategy

The JBI[@noauthor_jbi_2020] guidelines state that at least two databases should be subject to an initial search, thereafter a second search using all identified keywords should be conducted, and then the reference list of all identified sources should be consulted for additional documents. While these guidelines are sound, following this strategy is not feasible in our case due to the breadth of the literature we are interested in. Therefore we deviate from the JBI manual in this area.

Since the field we are interested in is psychology, searching databases outside psychology will have to include field limitations that would not be needed in psychology specific data bases such as PsychInfo. Therefore, we will only search PsychInfo, since that database provides us with a natural exclusion of documents outside the field of psychology. As an extension of this strategy we use PsychInfo classification categories to get a representative sample of papers across the many sub-fields within psychology. To this end we limit our search to papers within the following categories: Physiological Psychology & Neuroscience (2500), Developmental Psychology (2800), Social Psychology (3000), Personality Psychology (3100), Organizational Psychology (3600), Forensic psychology & Legal Issues (4200). These categories are selected to ensure that a representative sample of different areas of psychology are searched for while limiting the number of search results.

### 3.1.3 Document Screening and Selection

The identified documents was screened using the software tool rayyan.ai, the main purpose of this was to utilise the rayyan screening environment and thus we did not use any automated tools. The screening was conducted in a two stage fashion where the abstracts from the initial search was screened for eligibility. After locating eligible studies, a stratified random selection of 5 studies from each of the six APA classification categories was conducted to get a total sample of 30. However, only 3 of the 5 studies selected from the Personality Psychology category could be located, which gave us a final sample of 28 articles. An over view of the entire search and selection procedure can be seen in figure 2.

### 3.1.4 Data Extraction

The data from the identified studies will be extracted into an excel code book based on an a priori constructed extraction instrument as is proper for scoping reviews [@munn_systematic_2018]. The extraction instrument is designed to answer a series of research questions derived from potential sources of heterogeneity based on the four Cambellian validities. The code book covers three main themes: general study characteristics, the presence of epistemic heterogeneity in the review, and how the authors dealt with the observed statistical heterogeneity. Across these three themes we will include notation of the aims of the study, the sub-field of the study, the population examined, the methodology used, exclusion criteria, findings/conclusion of the study, etc. The extraction instrument can be seen in its entirety in appendix A.

### 3.1.5 Data Analysis

The analysis of the data will consist of summarizing the motivation for the various choices made in the individual data points. These results will be presented with simple descriptive statistics but also with a qualitative analysis of how authors reason about their analysis choices and exclusion criteria with regards to heterogeneity. These results will then be compared across sub-fields to see if the practice of adjusting for heterogeneity varies dependent on the field. The qualitative analysis will aim to be descriptive and will not seek to find any emergent or latent themes within the data. The result will be an evidence map of how epistemic heterogeneity is accounted for in the exclusion criteria and the theory under investigation as well as how the statistical heterogeneity is handled by the authors.

## 3.2 The Qualitative Content Analysis

While we have a similar goal with our content analysis as with our scoping review, these methodologies are distinctly different from one another. In a content analysis, no systematic protocol is needed, and no synthesis of evidence is conducted. Instead, a fully qualitative approach is taken where the results of the analysis cannot be fully divorced from it's author(s), meaning that its reproducibility is weak. This does not mean that transparency falls by the wayside or that measures to ensure inter-rater-agreement is reduced, but rather that the point of the analysis is not to give a systematically reproducible analysis of a literature.

A content analysis, as described by @elo_qualitative_2014, can be defined as "A flexible method for making valid inferences from data in order to provide new insight, describe a phenomenon through concepts or categories, and develop an understanding of the meaning of communications with a concern for intentions, consequences, and context." This makes it an apt method for our purposes since we aim to find cases of reported problematic heterogeneity in systematic reviews. We mean to locate instances where the apparent goal of the review is to pool data for a meta-analysis but the perceived epistemic heterogeneity was too large for a valid synthesis. That is, we are specifically looking of reviews that mention aspirations of meta-analytic pooling, but due to epistemic heterogeneity, that could not be done.

In order to make valid inferences about this phenomenon, we need to take context, intentions and communication from the authors conducting the study into account, thereby making a qualitative content analysis an appropriate method.

### 3.2.1 Search for Secondary Sources

To locate studies of this kind, a search for literature similar to that of the scoping review will be conducted with the addition of searching for heterogeneity in the abstracts, titles or keywords. Since the only type of heterogeneity present within systematic reviews is substantive, this additional keyword will help locate instances where the heterogeneity of the study population is challengingly high. No eligibility criteria for inclusion exists, this search procedure is simply a means of generating data from secondary sources and should not be confused with a systematic literature search. Thus, the search period was loosened to include studies published after 2017 in order to capture current research without being constrained to one particular year as was done in the scoping review. On October 18th, the following search was conducted using the terms and limitations provided in table 2.

A screening of the 955 documents on November first 2023 found 14 documents to be suitable for analysis since they indicated aspiration of mathematical synthesis but, due to epistemic heterogeneity was not possible.

### 3.2.2 Methodology

The qualitative content analysis will be conducted using an inductive analysis with a critical realist framework. However, since the topic under investigation has a long history of study, we will be using the theoretical scaffolding of heterogeneity typology and the considerable work on validity stemming from the philosophy of science [@shadish_experimental_2002], thus the study will not be purely inductive. That is, we will be using a deductive-inductive approach[@hong_convergent_2017].

The analysis will follow the standard procedure of identifying studies, immersing oneself within the data, and developing the codebook as an information saturated picture of the concept under study is painted [@cho_reducing_2014]. However, three initial categories consisting of external, internal, and construct validity will be taken from the extraction instrument of the scoping review in order to structure the codes. This will in turn allow us to create a categorisation matrix where we can bolster interrater agreement and provide a semblance of systematic objectivity in the coding of the articles. These categories also serve as an a priori Epoché (Bracketing) of what we expect to find in the systematic reviews. Through this we aim to ground the analysis in theory as well as provide some transparency regarding the authors motivation and expectations from the analysis. That being that the failure to mathematically synthesise evidence is a result of lacking internal, external or construct validity in the pool of studies included in the systematic review.

After coding the articles and assigning the codes to our pre-defined categories, the hermeneutic-circle will be employed to redefine the categories and create new ones where needed. This will be done to extract as much information as possible from the systematic reviews and provide more nuance to the issue of heterogeneity in those types of syntheses. This specific procedure is selected to suit our research question and the overall purpose of this paper. However, It should be noted that no absolute guidelines for how to conduct a qualitative content analysis exists, making it a flexible but challenging research method.

## 3.3 Mixing

Following the guidelines provided by JBI \[\@noauthor_chapter_2020-1\], the mixing procedure will follow a convergent design where each study informs the other to answer our singular research question of how epistemic heterogeneity hinders evidence synthesis. We will utilise a 'qualitising' transformation where the evidence map from the scoping review will be integrated into the categories identified in the qualitative analysis \[\@thomas_methods_2008\], \[\@hong_convergent_2017\]. This will provide us with a thematic synthesis that can highlight the issues posed by the presence of epistemic heterogeneity in the assessment of evidence, both from a qualitative and quantitative perspective.
